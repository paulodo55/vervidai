# üö® SECURITY ALERT - API Key Exposure

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**API Key Exposed**: The Gemini API key was accidentally committed to the GitHub repository in documentation files.

**Exposed Key**: `AIzaSyAxtFBj-LWKk6dahgrwMgutGLPMnpIAFjE`

## üîß IMMEDIATE STEPS TO TAKE

### 1. **REVOKE THE EXPOSED API KEY** (CRITICAL - DO THIS FIRST)

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Find the API key: `AIzaSyAxtFBj-LWKk6dahgrwMgutGLPMnpIAFjE`
3. **DELETE/REVOKE** this key immediately
4. This will prevent any unauthorized usage

### 2. **CREATE A NEW API KEY**

1. In Google AI Studio, click "Create API Key"
2. Select "Create API key in new project" or use existing project
3. Copy the new API key (keep it secure!)

### 3. **UPDATE YOUR ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**

**In Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to your Vervid project settings
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Update `GEMINI_API_KEY` with your new key
4. Redeploy your application

**For Local Development:**
```bash
# Create new .env.local file with new key
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here" > .env.local
echo "ADMIN_API_KEY=your_secure_admin_key_here" >> .env.local
```

### 4. **MONITOR FOR UNAUTHORIZED USAGE**

1. Check Google AI Studio usage dashboard
2. Look for any unexpected API calls
3. Monitor billing for unusual charges
